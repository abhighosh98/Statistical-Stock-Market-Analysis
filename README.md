# Statistical Stock Market Analysis
<b>Project Aim</b>
To understand the stock market data purely from a statistical viewpoint. To do this I will not be viewing this as time series data. I will be doing that in a future project after I get more familiar with time series. This project also fits a number of baseline models in order to extract insights(if any) from this kind of data.
